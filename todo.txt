Vorge TODO List for Personal Record (Not Official)

[ ] For movement, when you change directions, wait until you reach the destination 
    tile before you actually start to go in the next direction

[X] Implement setting flag to switch between tile-based and pixel-based

[ ] Right now, the walking animation is specific to the test sprite; I need to
    modify it--make it based off of speed and number of animation frames

[ ] Optimize render calls by caching the context and passing that around
    instead of the canvas
